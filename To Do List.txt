Filtering UI (e.g., filter by type, subType, or genre) - done

Sorting entries (e.g., by title, rating, or status) - done

Delete confirmation - done

Separate page for add and edit - maybe separate both - done

Tag badges for genres instead of plain text - done

Dark mode toggle or improved responsive design

Begin backend setup (replace localStorage with C#/SQL API)



Future Ideas:

group all the filtering and sorting controls inside a form or div for styling and layout consistency

replace confirm() with a custom modal for delete confirmation

show a toast message after deletion

allow undo of delete entry (via temp buffer)

toggle tags for the checkboxes in the form
